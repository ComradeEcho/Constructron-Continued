    - Mining a Constructron gives the player a Spidertron instead.

  Known issues:
    - Constructrons will attempt to finish the deconstruction queue when the inventory is full.
    - Missed deconstructions will no long be considered by Contructrons until the entity is deconstructed again.
    - Placing Constructrons whilst there are active jobs may cause a crash.
