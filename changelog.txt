Version: 1.0.11
Date: 2022-03-09
  Fixes:
    - Resolved a crash in Constructron staging when no stations were placed.
    - Resolved a crash in go_to_position retry when a companion was no longer valid.
    - Fixed companion Constructrons not resetting thier status after the leader became invalid.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill-like tiles are not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.0.8
Date: 2022-02-26
  Improvements:
    - Surface support! using this mod with Space Exploration is now possible.
    - Visual debuging! Massive improvements to the debug view so it is alot more obvious to see what a Constructron is doing.
    - Constructrons will now request/refill robots based on two new mod settings, robot_name and robot_count.
    - Service Stations now have a new look.
    - Construction and Deconstruction jobs will now be fulfilled by another Constructron after the original stops existing.
    - Deconstruction jobs now have better logic to detect when a Constructrons inventory is full. The process is much faster but still needs work.
    - Added Fuzzy pathing logic to assist when entities are placed in tight places or when using mods like MazeRibbon018.
    - Constructrons will now retry move actions after a few seconds instead of max_jobtime.
    - Constructrons and Service Stations are now registered entities so their removal will be captured regardless of how they are removed.
  Fixes:
    - Resolved the 'next_station' crash when only one Service Station was placed.
    - Resolved an issue with unconstructucted rails being detected by the post job check.
  Space Exploration notes:
    - Space platform tiles are not constructed at this time for the same reason as Landfill.
    - Constructrons do not travel between surfaces themselves.
  Misc:
    - A discord has been created for discussions, ideas, bugs etc. https://discord.gg/m9TDSsH3u2
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.

Version: 1.0.7
Date: 2022-02-09
  Improvements:
    - Added the ability to construct tiles! Landfill (and others like Landfill) is unfortunately still not possible at this stage. Landfill is specifically ignored.
    - Significantly more validation is performed at all job stages to prevent crashes.
    - Added event listening for when mods add modules to an entity (i.e Module Inerter) so Constructrons will now build modules even if a ghost is not created.
    - Constructrons will now move to other service stations in hope of fulfilling their logistic request at the new station after max_jobtime is reached. More logic to be added to make this smarter later.
    - Added Krastorio 2 support with equipment grids in Constructrons.
  Fixes:
    - Clean up service stations and constructrons that are destroyed which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Clean up service stations that are removed by bots which will prevent crashes at various stages.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after overshooting its destination due to moving too fast after max_jobtime is reached.
    - Constructrons will now retry to move into position after max_jobtime if a player interferes with the Contructron either by driving the Constructron or using a connected Spidertron Remote to it.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue even if the inventory is full.
    - If something happens to the Constructron during an active job it continues as if nothing is wrong. There are checks in place to queue another job however.
    - The Landfill tile is not constructed as this requires changes to the pathing calculation.

Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2022-01-30
  Improvements:
    - Deconstruction jobs now adhere to the same 5 second(default) delay to allow for robots to deconstruct the entities.
    - Upgrade jobs now adhere to the same 5 second(default) delay to allow for robots to upgrade the entities.
    - Job start delay is now configurable. Allow more or less time for robots to finish building before a job is queued.
    - Ghosts created by other mods (such as Recursive Blueprints) will now be built.
    - Entities created by other mods that are not buildable by the player, like those found in Logistic Train Network(LTN) will now be skipped from logistic requests.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2022-01-25

    - Contructrons will now rebuild entities that die. I.e are destroyed by biters or players.

    - Alternate recipes. An easy mode and normal mode. Toggle this from the game menu > settings > mod settings > startup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2022-01-13

    - Linear constructron job assignment.

    - Crash on Constructron placement.

    - Major performance improvements to ghost and deconstruction entity processing.
    - Ability to set maximum amount of time a job can take before timing out and returning home in the mod settings. Default is 2 minutes.
    - Code refactoring.
  Known issues:
    - After job time out, Constructrons will attempt to finish the build or deconstruction queue when the inventory is full.
    - Missed ghosts and deconstructions will no longer be considered by Contructrons until the entity is deconstructed again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2022-01-10
  Fixes:
    - Mining a Constructron gives the player a Spidertron instead.
    - Partially fixed deconstruction process when Constructron inventory fills. Constructrons will not get stuck any more eliminating manual intervention.
  Known issues:
    - Constructrons will attempt to finish the deconstruction queue when the inventory is full.
    - Missed deconstructions will no longer be considered by Contructrons until the entity is deconstructed again.
